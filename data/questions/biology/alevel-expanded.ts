    question: 'BOSS BATTLE: In 2023, researchers discovered a high-carb endurance drink formulation. Which bond joins glucose monomers in starch, making it an energy storage molecule rather than structural like cellulose?',

    explanation: 'That extra -OH on carbon 2 of ribose is RNA\'s Achilles heel. It can attack the phosphate backbone, causing hydrolysis. DNA\'s deoxyribose lacks this group - hence "deoxy" - making it much more stable. This is why mRNA vaccines needed ultra-cold storage!',
