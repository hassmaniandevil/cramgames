# CramGames Question Gamification Guide

## Core Philosophy: Fun First, Learning Follows

Questions should feel like playing a game, not taking a test. Every question is an opportunity for:
- A laugh
- An "aha!" moment
- A pop culture connection
- A real-world revelation

## Question Design Principles

### 1. The Hook Matters
Instead of: "What is the formula for speed?"
Write: "A TikToker claims they can run faster than Usain Bolt. If Bolt covers 100m in 9.58s, what speed (in m/s) would they need to beat?"

### 2. Pop Culture Integration
- Reference current memes, games, shows, music
- Use relatable scenarios (social media, gaming, school life)
- Include Easter eggs for fans

### 3. Humor Types That Work
- Absurdist scenarios (a penguin doing chemistry)
- Self-aware exam humor ("Unlike your procrastination...")
- Gentle roasts of subjects ("History: where we learn people made worse decisions than you")
- Unexpected twists in questions

### 4. Wrong Answers Should Be Fun
Instead of: A) 10, B) 12, C) 14, D) 16
Write: A) 10, B) "Math is hard", C) 14, D) "I'll guess C"

But also include plausible wrong answers that teach common misconceptions.

### 5. Explanations = Mini Celebrations
- Start with validation: "You got it!" or "Nice try! Here's the deal..."
- Use analogies teens understand
- End with a fun fact or connection

## Question Archetypes

### 🎮 The Gamer
"In Minecraft, a creeper explodes with a force of 65 TNT units. If the blast radius is proportional to force^0.5, what's the radius when force = 100?"

### 📱 The Social Media
"A tweet goes viral, doubling its likes every hour. Starting with 1 like, how many hours until it hits 1 million? (Use logarithms)"

### 🎬 The Movie Buff
"Thanos snapped away half of all life. If Earth had 8 billion people, and they reproduce at 1.1% annually, how long to recover?"

### 🍕 The Relatable
"You're splitting a pizza with friends. 3/8 is pepperoni, 1/4 is margherita. What fraction is left for the weird pineapple people?"

### 🏆 The Challenge
"BOSS BATTLE: Only 12% of students get this right. Can you?"

### 🤯 The Mind-Blower
"Did you know your body has enough iron to make a 3-inch nail? If an average body has 4g of iron, what's that in moles? (Fe = 56)"

## Level-Specific Tone

### KS3 (Ages 11-14)
- More silly humor
- Gaming references (Roblox, Minecraft, Fortnite)
- YouTube/TikTok culture
- School life scenarios

### GCSE (Ages 14-16)
- Slightly more sophisticated humor
- Social media, music, streaming
- Real exam tips woven in
- Career connections

### A-Level (Ages 16-18)
- Witty, intellectual humor
- University preview content
- Real research connections
- Industry applications

## Gamification Mechanics in Questions

### Streaks & Combos
- Questions that reference the player's streak
- "Keep your 🔥 alive! Quick one:"

### Achievement Unlocks
- Questions that unlock lore
- "Answer correctly to reveal a secret about [topic]"

### Boss Battles
- Harder questions with special framing
- Multi-part challenges
- Time pressure elements

### Easter Eggs
- Hidden jokes in wrong answers
- References that reward attentive players
- Callback questions to earlier content

## Content Variety Requirements

Each topic should have:
- 60% Standard questions (still fun, but straightforward)
- 20% Scenario-based (stories, real-world)
- 10% Challenge/Boss questions
- 10% Quick-fire/Easy confidence boosters

## The Fun Audit

Before adding a question, ask:
1. Would I want to answer this?
2. Does it have personality?
3. Is there at least one element that could make someone smile?
4. Does the explanation teach AND entertain?

If no to any: Rewrite it.
