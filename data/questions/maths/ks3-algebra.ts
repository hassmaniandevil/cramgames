    correctAnswer: 'Coefficient',
    wrongAnswers: ['Variable', 'Constant', 'Exponent'],
    options: ['Coefficient', 'Variable', 'Constant', 'Exponent'],
    explanation: 'The coefficient is the number that multiplies the variable. Here, 3 is multiplying x, so 3 is the coefficient. Think of it as x\'s hype man - it tells you how many x\'s you\'ve got!',
